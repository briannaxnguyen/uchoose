🎓 **UChoose — Ontario University Program Finder (Early Development)**

UChoose is an upcoming web-based tool designed to simplify one of the biggest decisions in a young adult’s life: choosing the right post-secondary program in Ontario.

Currently, most university decision platforms are outdated, generalized, and overwhelming to navigate. UChoose aims to flip that narrative by putting **"U" first in university** — delivering a personalized, interactive, and student-first experience to help high school students find the best-fit programs with ease.

## 🔧 Project Status

This repository is in the **very early stages of development**. The current contents include:

- 🔍 Web scraping scripts to gather program and university data from [OUInfo](https://www.ouinfo.ca/)
- 📦 Raw data files containing a list of Ontario university programs, including metadata like field of study, location, co-op availability, and more
- 🧪 Experimental prototypes for onboarding flows and filtering logic (in progress)
- ⚠️ The actual UChoose web application has not been built yet. What you see here are foundational steps to prepare the data and logic that will eventually power the platform

## 💡 Vision

UChoose will eventually offer:

- ✅ A modern, mobile-friendly UI
- ✅ Smart filtering and personalized recommendations based on user input (e.g., interests, learning style, career goals)
- ✅ Intuitive onboarding to narrow down choices without overwhelming the user
- ✅ A clear summary of shortlisted programs with pros/cons tailored to the student's needs

## 🙋‍♀️ Who Is This For?

This tool is intended for:

- Ontario high school students exploring post-secondary options
- Parents and guidance counselors helping with decisions
- Anyone overwhelmed by outdated or overly generalized university program platforms

## 🧠 Inspiration

UChoose was inspired by the belief that choosing your future shouldn’t feel like flipping through encyclopedias. We believe that **personalized, intuitive design** can make university exploration exciting instead of exhausting.
