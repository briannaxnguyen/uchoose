Notes: NEW Level 2 Program: Bachelor of Health Sciences (Integrated Rehabilitation and Humanities)

The new program brings humanities education offered by the Faculty of Humanities and combines it with the clinical knowledge of rehabilitation. This will create a unique undergraduate program that is focused on training empathetic professionals and engaged citizens.

In this program, just over half of the content will be offered by the Faculty of Health Sciences; just over one-third by the Faculty of Humanities; and the remaining one-sixth from other university courses to fulfill the learning outcomes of the program. With this structure, students in the BHSc (Integrated Rehabilitation and Humanities) will encounter strong experiential learning components, options for clinical research and opportunities to participate in community engagement.
